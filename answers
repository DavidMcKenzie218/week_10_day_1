1 - The output will be My name is Keith, to the console.
  -This is becaus the function will access the global variable name and contrastinate(Is this the right spelling?) it into the output to the console.

2 - The output to the console will be 3.
  - This is because the function variable will take presidence over the global variable. 

3 - 0: Ducks
    1: Dogs
    2: Lions
  - This is because the local array will take presidence over the global variable. The or loop will loop over the array and output the number that the loop is on followed by the animal in the corrisponding element of the array.

4 - Suspects include: Jay, Val, Harvey, Rick.
    Suspect three is: Keith

  -This is because the function variable will take presidence inside of the function but will not overwrite the global variable.

5 - Poirot
  - This is because the value to the name key will be overwritten in the first function, detectiveInfo.

6 - the mureder is valerie
  - The muderer variable will be overwritten twice, the first time in the outer function and then again in the inner function because of the closure principle.

7 - var firstName = function(){
  return "David";
}

var lastName = function(){
  return "McKenzie";
}

var age = function(month, year){
  var age = 2016 - year;
  var month = 9 - month;
  if (month < 0){
    return Math.abs(age-1);
  }else{
  return Math.abs(age);
}
}

var name = function(firstName, secondName, age, month, year){
  console.log(firstName() + " " + secondName() + " and you are " + age(month, year));
}

name(firstName, lastName, age, 11, 1993);
